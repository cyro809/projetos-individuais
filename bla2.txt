So please don't say you wanna give up,
How do I tell and then I'm fallen in love (how do I tell my baby).
And I know your waiting patiently for that day, when we
no longer have to lie about us (whoa ooooo).
When I walk around all I want is she touch,
and when you call me I don't wanna hang up.
And I know I say it often but I can't wait, till we
No longer have to lie about us.

Baby won't you wait
Just a little bit, just a little bit, (baby) just a little bit longer (baby), longer
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, (baby I'm wait for you) longer, longer (won't you wait)
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, longer, longer (if you wait)
Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit, longer.

Just a little bit
just a little bit
just a little bit
just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
