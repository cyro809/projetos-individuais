So please don't say you wanna give up,
How do I tell and then I'm fallen in love (how do I tell my baby).
And I know your waiting patiently for that day, when we
no longer have to lie about us (whoa ooooo).
When I walk around all I want is she touch,
and when you call me I don't wanna hang up.
And I know I say it often but I can't wait, till we
No longer have to lie about us.
