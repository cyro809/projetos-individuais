Baby I know,
When we started out there were things you didn't know,
But baby girl,
We got a lot of things we need to discuss
I know I'm asking for allot, but just trust.
You say that things getting old, sneaking round, creeping and love on the low
But baby girl
I can't wait till it's officially us,
I can't wait to let them know about us.

[Nicole]
First I thought that I could take you boy but I don't know,
You told me you were gonna leave her for me long ago.
[Avant]
Eventually I will but I just gotta take it slow
Don't wanna break your heart, although I gotta letter go
So baby..

So please don't say you wanna give up.
How do I tell and then I'm fallen in love,
and I know your waiting patiently for that day, when we
No longer have to lie about us?
When I walk around all I want is she touch,
And when you call me I don't wanna hang up,
and I know I say it often but I can't wait, till we
No longer have to lie about us.

Baby I know
Situation don't seem fair to us both.
But baby girl,
She's an issue that I'm bout to adjust.
Don't mistake our love is mend for just us.
You are my soul, mind, body, spirit
All that I know.
But baby girl,
I can't wait till it's officially us,
I can't wait to tell the world about us.
